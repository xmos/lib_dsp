/** Function that computes a fast fixed point atan2 and hypothenuse. The input
 * comprises an array of two integers (notionally a complex number with the
 * real value stored in the first index, and the imaginary value stored in
 * the second index). The output overwrites the input, and comprises a
 * hypothenuse (stored in the first index) and an angle (stored in the
 * second index).
 *
 * The input values are signed fixed point integers [-0x7FFF FFFF..0x7FFF
 * FFFF] with the fixed point in an arbitrary location, the output
 * hypothenuse is an unsigned fixed point integer with the fixed point in
 * the same location. The output angle is a value in the range [-0x4000
 * 0000.. 0x4000 0000] representing the angle; 0 indicates a positive real
 * part and a zero imaginary part, with angles increasing anti clockwise.
 * Hence 0x4000 0000 represents PI radians (180 degrees).
 *
 * The function allows for a trade-off to be made between accuracy and speed.
 *
 * The precision parameter should be set to (24-N) to request N bits
 * accuracy in the hypothenuse and angle. Hence, the value 0 requests a
 * 24-bit accurate hypothenuse/angle, whereas 23 requests a 1-bit accurate
 * hypothenuse/angle. precision must be between 0 and 23 inclusive.
 *
 * Execution time is 31 + 5 N thread cycles; at most 151 thread cycles for
 * 24 bit, at its fastest it will take 36 thread cycles for 1-bit
 * precision. Note that for high precision, atan() with a division may be
 * faster, but that will not compute the hypotenusa.
 *
 * atan2(0,0) returns a 0 hypothenuse and an arbitrary angle
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  \code
 *  int z[2] = {1000,1000}
 *  dsp_math_atan2_hypot(z, 0);
 *  \endcode
 *
 * results in 1414 (unsigned int stored in z[0]), and 0x0fff ffe1 (signed
 * int, stored in z[1]). The former is 1000*sqrt(2), the latter is a 45
 * degree angle represented by 0x1000 0000 calculated to a precision of 26
 * bits
